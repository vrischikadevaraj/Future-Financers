      <h2>Finance Your Future</h2><br>
      <h3>By Students for Students</h3>
      <p class="mission"> 
My goal is to educate kids on financial literacy to ensure that their future consists of strong financial support and smart money choices. Many people don't learn about money management, savings or investments until well into their adult years.
They can graduate without understanding how budgeting, saving, or investing works, which can cause serious financial stress later down in life.
Educating kids early can give them the extra leg up and allow them to have the skills in place to support themselves in the future.<br><br>
Financial literacy is not just about making money though.
It is about understanding how money works in everyday life.
Students are constantly making financial decisions, even without realizing it.
By learning how this money flows throughout your life, it can help you gain confidence and develop good habits.<br><br>
Learning how to manage money successfully is a crucial life skill and learning it at an early age can have serious advantages.
By learning how to budget, invest, and save, students can make better decisions and feel more confident and prepared for adulthood.
